## ‚öôÔ∏è Environment Variables

If your app uses environment variables, add them in Netlify:

1. Go to your site settings in Netlify
2. Navigate to "Environment variables"
3. Add your variables:
   ```
   NODE_ENV=production
   REACT_APP_API_URL=your-api-url
   ```

## üîß Custom Domain

1. **Add Custom Domain**
   - Go to your site settings in Netlify
   - Navigate to "Domain management"
   - Click "Add custom domain"
   - Follow the DNS configuration instructions

2. **SSL Certificate**
   - Netlify automatically provides SSL certificates
   - No additional configuration needed

## üìä Performance Optimization

### Build Optimization

The template is already optimized for production:

- **Code Splitting**: Parcel automatically splits your code
- **Image Optimization**: Images are optimized during build
- **Minification**: CSS and JS are minified
- **Tree Shaking**: Unused code is removed

### Netlify Optimizations

The `netlify.toml` file includes:

- **Caching Headers**: Static assets are cached for 1 year
- **Security Headers**: XSS protection, content type options
- **Redirect Rules**: SPA routing support

## üîç Monitoring

### Netlify Analytics

1. **Enable Analytics**
   - Go to your site settings
   - Navigate to "Analytics"
   - Enable "Netlify Analytics"

2. **View Metrics**
   - Page views
   - Unique visitors
   - Top pages
   - Referrers

### Performance Monitoring

1. **Lighthouse Scores**
   - Use Chrome DevTools
   - Run Lighthouse audit
   - Monitor Core Web Vitals

2. **Real User Monitoring**
   - Consider tools like Sentry
   - Monitor error rates
   - Track performance metrics

## üö® Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Build Fails**
   ```bash
   # Check build locally first
   yarn build
   
   # Check for missing dependencies
   yarn install
   ```

2. **404 Errors on Refresh**
   - Ensure `netlify.toml` has redirect rules
   - Check that SPA routing is configured

3. **Environment Variables Not Working**
   - Verify variable names start with `REACT_APP_`
   - Check Netlify environment variable settings

4. **Slow Build Times**
   - Enable build caching in Netlify
   - Consider using build plugins
   - Optimize dependencies
